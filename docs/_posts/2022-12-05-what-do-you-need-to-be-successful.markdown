Today, we're going to look back on one of those moments that seems innocuous at the time but in retrospect ended up shaping who you are.

A year or two into my career, I was working in IT Operations supporting an application written by developers a quarter of the world away. It had issues, shall we say, "not infrequently," and we were on the hook to support it and make it work. I was just getting started on this team and had successfully convinced my management to onboard with this newfangled log searching and analysis tool called Splunk. I was absolutely *enamored* with it. I was so excited when we finally got our application's logs loaded into the tool and spent few days just digging through them trying to find anything useful. Unfortunately, I was coming up empty. Sure, I had the access logs from IIS, but actual application logs were pretty sparse and didn't really contain anything useful. I had this new and expensive tool that was to be the backbone of our operations processes and it was a complete waste.

As I'm sitting here trying to figure out what to do, a director from a different part of the company was walking around. He did this every morning, and I thought it was just some helicopter management or something. He stopped at my desk and asked how I was doing. I answered him truthfully, "I'm alright." He asked, "Why just 'alright'?"

I proceeded to explain the situation to him, frustrated and exasperated. I was expecting some commiseration at best, but he asked me an unexpected question:

"What do you need to be successful?"

I told him, rather sassily, that I needed the developers to put some useful application logs in when there are errors or other issues!

"Are you free for lunch?"

Another unexpected question. It was early in the morning still and I hadn't made any plans, so I told him yes.

A few more hours went by until lunch time started coming around. He showed up at my desk with someone I had never seen or heard of before. He introduced us, and I find out that this person is one of the lead developers of the application I needed logs for. We're going to lunch together, apparently, to talk it over.

We went to a standby lunch spot down the road, a Turkish restaurant (the blue one, never the red one). We talked about the issue and the problem I was trying to solve, went back and forth a bit asking questions and answering. By the time we wrapped up, he told him he'd get a ticket into the next Sprint to improve error logging.

Now, in retrospect, this conversation I had with the developer was a completely normal thing that happens millions of times a day. At the time, though, I was too inexperienced to know that. I had no idea how to overcome my problem of contacting the developers and convincing them to spend precious development time on something I wanted.

I don't want to look at that, though. I want to look at what the director did.

**He was proactive.** The director was looking for problems that needed addressed. He wasn't waiting for people to complain or bring things up. He was on a mission, and that mission was to help people be successful.

**He was selective.** He didn't ask everyone in the room how they were as some rote activity. He looked for people who were frustrated and went to find out why.

**He clarified.** I was really just complaining at the time. I had no notion in my mind that he'd be able to help. I barely knew who he was. He helped me translate that frustration into a specific thing I needed.

**He wasn't prescriptive.** At no point did he tell me what I needed to do. He trusted that I knew what needed done and was helping me be successful at it.

**He let me solve my own problem.** He didn't go and tell the developers to add error logs. Instead, he set me up to solve my own problem. All I needed was someone to talk to about the issue who had the power to do something. He made that connection and then ducked out.


As a leader, you cannot solve everyone's problems for them. You cannot tell them what to do or how to do it. That's the behavior of a boss, not a leader. A leader asks people the vital question "What do you need to be successful?", sets them up with what they need, and gets the hell out of the way.
